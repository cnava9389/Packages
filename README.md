# Packages

A repo filled with packages that I personally use in my projects

## Rust

The rust folder is filled with rust libraries that I wrote to help me with
my projects. It consists of tools used in creating a smoother web development
experience.

## TS

The typescript folder similarly will have helper libraries with functions that I find myself
needing a lot. May also have framework specific subfolders for ease of use when working in said framework.
